# Changelog

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Added support for Sonnet 4.6 and removed old models support.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-11

### Changed

- **Header Identity Alignment** - `ideType` changed from `IDE_UNSPECIFIED` to `ANTIGRAVITY` and `platform` from `PLATFORM_UNSPECIFIED` to dynamic `WINDOWS`/`MACOS` (based on `process.platform`) across all header sources (`getAntigravityHeaders`, `oauth.ts`, `project.ts`). Now matches Antigravity Manager behavior

- **Gemini CLI `Client-Metadata` Header** - Gemini CLI requests now include `Client-Metadata` header, aligning with actual `gemini-cli` behavior. Previously only Antigravity-style requests sent this header

- **Gemini CLI User-Agent Format** - Updated from `GeminiCLI/{ver}/{model}` to `GeminiCLI/{ver}/{model} ({platform}; {arch})` to match real `gemini-cli` UA strings. Version pool updated from `1.2.0/1.1.0/1.0.0` to `0.28.0/0.27.4/0.27.3` to align with actual release numbers

- **Randomized Headers Model-Aware** - `getRandomizedHeaders()` now accepts an optional `model` parameter, embedding the actual model name in Gemini CLI User-Agent strings instead of a hardcoded default

- **Fingerprint Platform Alignment** - Antigravity-style `Client-Metadata` platform now consistently matches the randomized User-Agent platform, fixing a potential mismatch where headers could disagree on reported platform

### Removed

- **Linux Fingerprints** - Removed `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` from `ANTIGRAVITY_PLATFORMS` and fingerprint generation. Linux users now masquerade as macOS (Antigravity does not support Linux as a native platform)

- **`getAntigravityUserAgents()` Function** - Removed unused helper that had no callers in the codebase

- **`X-Opencode-Tools-Debug` Header** - Removed debug telemetry header from outgoing requests

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Account Verification Flow** - Auth login menu now supports `verify` and `verify-all` actions. When Antigravity returns a 403 with `validation_required`, the account is automatically disabled, marked with a verification URL, and cooled down. Users can verify accounts directly from the menu with a probe request to confirm resolution

- **Dynamic Antigravity Version** - Plugin version is now fetched at startup from the Antigravity updater API, with a changelog-scrape fallback and a hardcoded last-resort. Eliminates stale "version no longer supported" errors after Antigravity updates

- **Storage V4 Schema** - New storage version adds `verificationRequired`, `verificationRequiredAt`, `verificationRequiredReason`, `verificationUrl`, and `fingerprintHistory` fields per account. Full migration chain from v1/v2/v3 to v4

- **`saveAccountsReplace`** - New destructive-write storage function that replaces the entire accounts file without merging, preventing deleted accounts from being resurrected by concurrent reads

- **`setAccountEnabled` / Account Toggling** - New account management methods: `setAccountEnabled()`, `markAccountVerificationRequired()`, `clearAccountVerificationRequired()`, `removeAccountByIndex()`

- **Secure File Permissions** - Credential storage files are now created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only). Existing files with overly permissive modes are tightened on load

- **`opencode.jsonc` Support** - Configure models flow now detects and prefers existing `opencode.jsonc` files. JSONC parsing strips comments and trailing commas before JSON.parse

- **Header Contract Tests** - New `src/constants.test.ts` validates header shapes, randomization behavior, and optional header fields for both Antigravity and Gemini CLI styles

### Changed

- **Unified Gemini Routing** - Gemini quota fallback between Antigravity and Gemini CLI pools is now always enabled for Gemini models. The `quota_fallback` config flag is deprecated and ignored (backward-compatible, no breakage)

- **`cli_first` Honored in Routing** - `resolveHeaderRoutingDecision()` centralizes routing logic and properly respects `cli_first` for unsuffixed Gemini models

- **Fingerprint Headers Simplified** - `buildFingerprintHeaders()` now returns only `User-Agent`. Removed `X-Goog-QuotaUser`, `X-Client-Device-Id`, `X-Goog-Api-Client`, and `Client-Metadata` from outgoing content requests to align with Antigravity Manager behavior

- **Client Metadata Reduced** - Fingerprint client metadata trimmed to `ideType`, `platform`, `pluginType` only. Removed `osVersion`, `arch`, `sqmId`

- **Gemini CLI User-Agent Format** - Updated from `google-genai-sdk/...` to `GeminiCLI/...` format

- **Search Model** - Changed from `gemini-2.0-flash` to `gemini-2.5-flash` for improved search result quality

- **Deterministic Search Generation** - Search requests now use `temperature: 0` and `topP: 1` instead of thinking config

- **OAuth Headers Dynamic** - `oauth.ts` and `project.ts` now use `getAntigravityHeaders()` instead of static constants, removing stale `X-Goog-Api-Client` from token/project calls

### Fixed

- **#410**: Strip `x-goog-user-project` header for ALL header styles, not just Antigravity. This header caused 403 errors on Daily/Prod endpoints when the user's GCP project lacked Cloud Code API
- **#370 / #336**: Account deletion now persists correctly. Root cause: `saveAccounts()` merged deleted accounts back from disk. Fixed by introducing `saveAccountsReplace()` for destructive writes and syncing in-memory state immediately
- **#381**: Disabled accounts no longer selected via sticky index. `getCurrentAccountForFamily()` now skips disabled accounts and advances the active index
- **#384**: `google_search` tool no longer returns empty citations when using `gemini-3-flash`. Search model switched to `gemini-2.5-flash`
- **#377**: Configure models flow now respects existing `opencode.jsonc` files instead of creating duplicate `opencode.json`
- **Excessive Disk Writes** - Fixed project context auth updates causing 3000+ writes/sec during streaming. Changed from reference equality to value comparison on auth tokens and added throttled saves. Prevents SSD wear on macOS
- **Fingerprint Alignment** - Force-regenerated fingerprints to match current Antigravity Manager behavior, fixing `ideType` and stripping stale client metadata fields

### Removed

- **Extra Outgoing Headers** - `X-Goog-Api-Client`, `Client-Metadata`, `X-Goog-QuotaUser`, `X-Client-Device-Id` no longer sent on content requests
- **Fingerprint Metadata Fields** - `osVersion`, `arch`, `sqmId` removed from fingerprint client metadata
- **`updateFingerprintVersion` Helper** - Removed from accounts module (fingerprint version rewriting no longer needed)

### Documentation

- **AGENTS.md** expanded with detailed architecture, code style, and fingerprint system documentation
- **README.md**, **CONFIGURATION.md**, **MULTI-ACCOUNT.md** updated to reflect deprecated `quota_fallback` and automatic Gemini pool fallback behavior
- **`antigravity.schema.json`** marks `quota_fallback` as deprecated/ignored

## [1.4.5] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Configure Models Menu Action** - Auth login menu now includes a "Configure models" action that writes plugin model definitions directly into `opencode.json`, making setup easier for new users

- **`cli_first` Config Option** - New configuration option to route Gemini models to Gemini CLI quota first, useful for users who want to preserve Antigravity quota for Claude models

- **`toast_scope` Configuration** - Control toast visibility per session with `toast_scope: "root_only"` to suppress toasts in subagent sessions

- **Soft Quota Protection** - Skip accounts over 90% usage threshold to prevent Google penalties, with configurable `soft_quota_threshold_percent` and wait/retry behavior

- **Gemini CLI Quota Management** - Enhanced quota display with dual quota pool support (Antigravity + Gemini CLI)

- **`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` Environment Variable** - Custom config location support for non-standard setups

- **`quota_refresh_interval_minutes`** - Background quota cache refresh (default 15 minutes)

- **`soft_quota_cache_ttl_minutes`** - Cache freshness control for soft quota checks

### Changed

- **Model Naming and Routing** - Documented antigravity-prefixed model names and automatic mapping to CLI preview names (e.g., `antigravity-gemini-3-flash` → `gemini-3-flash-preview`)

- **Antigravity-First Quota Strategy** - Exhausts Antigravity quota across ALL accounts before falling back to Gemini CLI quota (previously per-account)

- **Quota Routing Respects `cli_first`** - Fallback behavior updated to respect `cli_first` preference

- **Config Directory Resolution** - Now prioritizes `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable

- **Enhanced Debug Logging** - Process ID included for better traceability across concurrent sessions

- **Improved Quota Group Resolution** - More consistent quota management with `resolveQuotaGroup` function

### Fixed

- **#337**: Skip disabled accounts in proactive token refresh
- **#233**: Skip sandbox endpoints for Gemini CLI models (fixes 404/403 cascade)
- **Windows Config Auto-Migration**: Automatically migrates config from `%APPDATA%\opencode\` to `~/.config/opencode/`
- **Root Session Detection**: Reset `isChildSession` flag correctly for root sessions
- **Stale Quota Cache**: Prevent spin loop on stale quota cache
- **Quota Group Default**: Fix quota group selection defaulting to `gemini-pro` when model is null

### Removed

- **Fingerprint Headers for Gemini CLI** - Removed fingerprint headers from Gemini CLI model requests to align with official behavior
- **`web_search` Configuration Leftovers** - Cleaned up remaining `web_search` config remnants from schema

### Documentation

- Updated README with model configuration options and simplified setup instructions
- Updated MODEL-VARIANTS.md with Antigravity model names and configuration guidance
- Updated CONFIGURATION.md to clarify `quota_fallback` behavior across accounts
- Updated MULTI-ACCOUNT.md with dual quota pool and fallback flow details

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Quota check and account management in auth login** - Added new `--quota` and `--manage` options to the `auth login` command for checking account quota status and managing accounts directly from the CLI ([#284](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/284))

- **Request timing jitter** - Added configurable random delay to requests to reduce detection patterns and improve rate limit resilience. Requests now include small random timing variations

- **Header randomization for fingerprint diversity** - Headers are now randomized to create more diverse fingerprints, reducing the likelihood of requests being grouped and rate-limited together

- **Per-account fingerprint persistence** - Fingerprints are now persisted per-account in storage, allowing consistent identity across sessions and enabling fingerprint history tracking
  - Added fingerprint restore operations to AccountManager
  - Extended per-account fingerprint history for better tracking
  - Fingerprint now shown in debug output

- **Scheduling mode configuration** - Added new scheduling modes including `cache-first` mode that prioritizes accounts with cached tokens, reducing authentication overhead

- **Failure count TTL expiration** - Account failure counts now expire after a configurable time period, allowing accounts to naturally recover from temporary issues

- **Exponential backoff for 503/529 errors** - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for capacity-related errors, matching behavior of Antigravity-Manager

### Changed

- **Increased MODEL_CAPACITY backoff to 45s with jitter** - Extended the base backoff time for model capacity errors from previous values to 45 seconds, with added jitter to prevent thundering herd issues

- **Regenerate fingerprint after capacity retry exhaustion** - When all capacity retries are exhausted, the fingerprint is now regenerated to potentially get assigned to a different backend partition

- **Enhanced duration parsing for Go format** - Improved parsing of duration strings to handle Go-style duration formats (e.g., `1h30m`) used in some API responses

### Fixed

- **Prevent toast spam for rate limit warnings** - Added 5-second debounce for rate limit warning toasts to prevent notification flooding when multiple requests hit rate limits simultaneously ([#286](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/286))

- **`getEnabledAccounts` now treats undefined as enabled** - Fixed issue where accounts without an explicit `enabled` field were incorrectly filtered out. Accounts now default to enabled when the field is undefined

- **Show correct position in account toast for enabled accounts** - Fixed the account position indicator in toast notifications to only count enabled accounts, showing accurate position like "Account 2/5" instead of including disabled accounts

- **Filter disabled accounts in all selection methods** - Ensured disabled accounts are properly excluded from all account selection strategies (round-robin, least-used, random, etc.)

- **Robust handling for capacity/5xx errors** - Implemented comprehensive retry logic for model capacity and server errors, achieving parity with Antigravity-Manager's behavior
  - Reordered parsing logic to prioritize capacity checks
  - Fixed loop retry logic to prevent state pollution
  - Added capacity retry limit to prevent infinite loops ([#263](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/263))

- **Fixed @opencode-ai/plugin dependency location** - Moved `@opencode-ai/plugin` from devDependencies to dependencies section, fixing runtime errors when the plugin was installed without dev dependencies

### Removed

- **Removed deprecated `web_search` configuration** - The deprecated `web_search.default_mode` and `web_search.grounding_threshold` configuration options have been fully removed. Use the `google_search` tool instead (introduced in 1.3.1)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **New `google_search` tool for web search** - Implements Google Search grounding as a callable tool that the model can invoke explicitly
  - Makes separate API calls with only `{ googleSearch: {} }` tool, avoiding Gemini API limitation where grounding tools cannot be combined with function declarations
  - Returns formatted markdown with search results, sources with URLs, and search queries used
  - Supports optional URL analysis via `urlContext` when URLs are provided
  - Configurable thinking mode (deep vs fast) for search operations
  - Uses `gemini-3-flash` model for fast, cost-effective search operations

### Changed

- Upgraded to Zod v4 and adjusted schema generation for compatibility
- **Deprecated `web_search` config** - The `web_search.default_mode` and `web_search.grounding_threshold` config options are now deprecated. Google Search is now implemented as a dedicated tool rather than automatic grounding injection

### Fixed

- **`keep_thinking=true` now works without debug mode** - Fixed Claude multi-turn conversations failing with "Failed to process error response" when `keep_thinking=true` after tool calls, unless debug mode was enabled
  - Root cause: `filterContentArray` trusted any signature >= 50 chars for last assistant messages, but Claude returns its own signatures that Antigravity doesn't recognize
  - Fix: Now verifies signatures against our cache via `isOurCachedSignature()` before passing through. Foreign/missing signatures get replaced with `SKIP_THOUGHT_SIGNATURE` sentinel
  - Why debug worked: Debug mode injects synthetic thinking with no signature, triggering sentinel injection correctly

- **Fixed tool calls failing for tools with no parameters** - Tools like `hive_plan_read`, `hive_status`, and `hive_feature_list` that have no required parameters would fail with Zod validation error `state.input: expected record, received undefined`
  - Root cause: When Claude calls a tool with no parameters, it returns `functionCall` without an `args` field. The response transformation only processed parts where `functionCall.args` was defined, leaving `args` as `undefined`
  - Fix: Changed condition to handle all `functionCall` parts, defaulting `args` to `{}` when missing, ensuring opencode's `state.input` always receives a valid record

- **Auth headers aligned with official Gemini CLI** - Updated authentication headers to match the official Antigravity/Gemini CLI behavior, reducing "account ineligible" errors and potential bans ([#178](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/178))
  - `GEMINI_CLI_HEADERS["User-Agent"]`: `9.15.1` → `10.3.0`
  - `GEMINI_CLI_HEADERS["X-Goog-Api-Client"]`: `gl-node/22.17.0` → `gl-node/22.18.0`
  - `ANTIGRAVITY_HEADERS["User-Agent"]`: Updated to full Chrome/Electron user agent string
  - Token exchange now includes `Accept`, `Accept-Encoding`, `User-Agent`, `X-Goog-Api-Client` headers
  - Userinfo fetch now includes `User-Agent`, `X-Goog-Api-Client` headers
  - `fetchProjectID` now uses centralized constants instead of hardcoded strings

- **`quiet_mode` now properly suppresses all toast notifications** - Fixed `quiet_mode: true` in `antigravity.json` not suppressing "Status dialog dismissed" and other toast notifications ([#207](https://github.com/NoeFabris/opencode-antigravity-auth/issues/207))
  - Root cause: The `showToast` helper function didn't check `quietMode`, and only some call sites had manual `!quietMode &&` guards
  - Fix: Moved `quietMode` check inside `showToast` helper so all toasts are automatically suppressed when `quiet_mode: true`

### Removed

- **Removed automatic `googleSearch` injection** - Previously attempted to inject `{ googleSearch: {} }` into all Gemini requests, which never worked due to API limitations. Now uses the explicit tool approach instead
